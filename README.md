### üöÄ DEVELOPER PROMPT: Build MVP for *Livestock HealthConnect* (Dummy Data Version)

**GOAL:**
Build a functional prototype of the *Livestock HealthConnect* platform‚Äîa system to connect livestock farmers in Buea with veterinarians. This is **a frontend+backend prototype (no real database)** using **dummy data** to simulate core flows.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Stack to Use

* **Frontend**: React.js 
* **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js (no DB needed; use in-memory data or JSON files)
* **State/Data**: Store data in memory or mock JSON objects
* **Optional**: Include comments where database calls would normally go

---

### üì± Must-Have Core Features (with Dummy Data)

#### 1. **User Roles**

* **Farmer**
* **Veterinarian**
* **Admin**
  Each role has its own dashboard and access controls. Simulate authentication with hardcoded user credentials.

---

#### 2. **Farmer Features**

* **Dashboard**

  * View nearby veterinarians (list from dummy JSON)
  * Request consultation (submit form ‚Üí adds to dummy array)
  * Receive consultation responses (simulate with dummy replies)
*Profile page*

  * View/edit profile details (dummy only)
Health Tips

  * Show 3‚Äì5 health tips in English and Pidgin (hardcoded JSON)

---

3. **Veterinarian Features**

* **Dashboard**

  * See incoming consultation requests
  * Respond to consultations (form + dummy response state)
  * Manage schedule (time slots from dummy JSON)
* **Prescription History**

  * List past dummy consultations and prescriptions


#### 4. **Admin Features**

* **Dashboard**

  * View registered vets and farmers (from dummy JSON)
  * ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù new vets (toggle a boolean `isVerified`)
  * View platform stats (e.g., "Total Consultations: 42" ‚Äì dummy values)


 üí¨ Communication Simulation

* **Simulate Chat**:

  * Simple textarea input to send/receive messages (use dummy message array)
* **Simulate Video/Call Option**:

  * Add a ‚ÄúStart Video‚Äù button (non-functional placeholder)
  * Label based on internet strength (simulate offline with toggle)



üß© System Features

* Language Toggle (English)
* Role-based navigation and views
* Notifications (basic alerts/popups for new consultations)



üîê Security Simulation

* Use role-based routing logic
* Show where token-based auth or PIN login would be implemented in real system
* Comment where HTTPS, encryption, or biometric login would be added



üéØ Success Criteria

* Navigable UI for each user type
* Dummy data flows simulate real operations
* Developer includes `// TODO` markers where API or DB integration would go
* Fully testable and deployable without external dependencies
